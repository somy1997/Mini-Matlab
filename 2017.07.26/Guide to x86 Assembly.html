<p>
This is a version adapted by Quentin Carbonneaux from David Evans'
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html">
original document</a>.  The syntax was changed from Intel to AT&amp;T,
the standard syntax on UNIX systems, and the HTML code was purified.

</p><p>
This guide describes the basics of 32-bit x86 assembly language
programming, covering a small but useful subset of the available
instructions and assembler directives.  There are several different
assembly languages for generating x86 machine code.  The one we will use
in CS421 is the GNU Assembler (gas) assembler. We will uses
the standard AT&amp;T syntax for writing x86 assembly code.

</p><p>
The full x86 instruction set is large and complex (Intel's x86
instruction set manuals comprise over 2900 pages), and we do not cover
it all in this guide. For example, there is a 16-bit subset of the x86
instruction set. Using the 16-bit programming model can be quite
complex. It has a segmented memory model, more restrictions on register
usage, and so on. In this guide, we will limit our attention to more
modern aspects of x86 programming, and delve into the instruction set
only in enough detail to get a basic feel for x86 programming.


</p><h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>

<p>
Modern (i.e 386 and beyond) x86 processors have eight 32-bit general
purpose registers, as depicted in Figure 1. The register names are
mostly historical. For example, EAX used to be called the
accumulator since it was used by a number of arithmetic operations, and
ECX was known as the counter since it was used to hold a loop
index. Whereas most of the registers have lost their special purposes in
the modern instruction set, by convention, two are reserved for special
purposes — the stack pointer (ESP) and the base pointer
(EBP).

</p><p>
For the EAX, EBX, ECX, and
EDX registers, subsections may be used. For example, the least
significant 2 bytes of EAX can be treated as a 16-bit register
called AX. The least significant byte of AX can be
used as a single 8-bit register called AL, while the most
significant byte of AX can be used as a single 8-bit register
called AH. These names refer to the same physical
register. When a two-byte quantity is placed into DX, the
update affects the value of DH, DL, and
EDX. These sub-registers are mainly hold-overs from older,
16-bit versions of the instruction set. However, they are sometimes
convenient when dealing with data that are smaller than 32-bits
(e.g. 1-byte ASCII characters).

<h2 id="memory">Memory and Addressing Modes</h2>

<h3>Declaring Static Data Regions</h3>

<p>
You can declare static data regions (analogous to global variables) in
x86 assembly using special assembler directives for this purpose. Data
declarations should be preceded by the <span class="keyword">.data</span>
directive. Following this directive, the directives <span class="keyword">.byte</span>, <span class="keyword">.short</span>, and <span class="keyword">.long</span> can be used to declare one, two, and four byte
data locations, respectively.  To refer to the address of the data created,
we can label them.  Labels are very useful and versatile in assembly, they
give names to memory locations that will be figured out later by the assembler
or the linker.  This is similar to declaring variables by name, but abides by
some lower level rules. For example, locations declared in sequence will be
located in memory next to one another.

</p><p>
Example declarations:

</p><blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><span class="keyword">.data</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="keyword">var:</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td></td><td><span class="keyword">.byte&nbsp;64</span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Declare a byte, referred to as location <em>var</em>, containing the value 64. */
  </span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td><td><span class="keyword">.byte&nbsp;10</span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Declare a byte with no label, containing the value 10.
    Its location is <em>var</em> + 1. */
   </span></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><span class="keyword">x:</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td></td><td><span class="keyword">.short&nbsp;42</span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Declare a 2-byte value initialized to 42, referred to as location <em>x</em>. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><span class="keyword">y:</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td></td><td><span class="keyword">.long&nbsp;30000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
  /* Declare a 4-byte value, referred to as location <em>y</em>, initialized to 30000. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike in high level languages where arrays can have many dimensions and
are accessed by indices, arrays in x86 assembly language are simply a
number of cells located contiguously in memory. An array can be declared
by just listing the values, as in the first example below.
For the special case of an array of bytes, string literals can be used.
In case a large area of memory is filled with zeroes the <span class="keyword">
.zero</span> directive can be used.

</p><p>
Some examples:

</p><blockquote>
<table>

<tbody><tr><td><span class="keyword">s:</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td></td><td><span class="keyword">.long 1, 2, 3</span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Declare three 4-byte values, initialized to 1,
    2, and 3. <br> The value at location <span class="keyword">s + 8</span>
    will be 3. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><span class="keyword">barr:</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td></td><td><span class="keyword">.zero 10</span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Declare 10 bytes starting at
    location <em>barr</em>, initialized to 0. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><span class="keyword">str:</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td></td><td><span class="keyword">.string "hello"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Declare 6 bytes starting at the address str initialized to <br>
    the ASCII character values
    for <span class="keyword">hello</span> followed by a nul (0) byte. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<h3>Addressing Memory</h3>

<p>
Modern x86-compatible processors are capable of addressing up to
2<sup>32</sup> bytes of memory: memory addresses are 32-bits wide. In
the examples above, where we used labels to refer to memory regions,
these labels are actually replaced by the assembler with 32-bit
quantities that specify addresses in memory. In addition to supporting
referring to memory regions by labels (i.e. constant values), the x86
provides a flexible scheme for computing and referring to memory
addresses: up to two of the 32-bit registers and a 32-bit signed
constant can be added together to compute a memory address. One of the
registers can be optionally pre-multiplied by 2, 4, or 8.

</p><p>
The addressing modes can be used with many x86 instructions
(we'll describe them in the next section). Here we illustrate some examples
using the <span class="keyword">mov</span> instruction that moves data
between registers and memory. This instruction has two operands: the
first is the source and the second specifies the destination.

</p><p>
Some examples of <span class="keyword">mov</span> instructions
using address computations are:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    mov (%ebx), %eax
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Load 4 bytes from the memory address in EBX into EAX. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    mov %ebx, var(,1)
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Move the contents of EBX into the 4 bytes at
    memory address <em>var</em>.<br> (Note, <em>var</em> is a 32-bit
    constant). */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    mov -4(%esi), %eax
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Move 4 bytes at memory address ESI + (-4) into EAX. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    mov %cl, (%esi,%eax,1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Move the contents of CL into the byte at address ESI+EAX. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    mov (%esi,%ebx,4), %edx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Move the 4 bytes of data at address ESI+4*EBX into EDX. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some examples of invalid address calculations include:

</p><blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    mov (%ebx,%ecx,-1), %eax
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Can only <b>add</b> register values. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    mov %ebx, (%eax,%esi,%edi,1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* At most <b>2</b> registers in address computation. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<h3>Operation Suffixes</h3>

<p>
In general, the intended size of the of the data item at a given memory
address can be inferred from the assembly code instruction in which it
is referenced. For example, in all of the above instructions, the size
of the memory regions could be inferred from the size of the register
operand.  When we were loading a 32-bit register, the assembler could
infer that the region of memory we were referring to was 4 bytes
wide. When we were storing the value of a one byte register to memory,
the assembler could infer that we wanted the address to refer to a
single byte in memory.

</p><p>
However, in some cases the size of a referred-to memory region is
ambiguous. Consider the instruction <span class="keyword">mov $2, (%ebx)</span>.
Should this instruction move the value 2 into the
single byte at address <span class="keyword">EBX</span>?  Perhaps
it should move the 32-bit integer representation of 2 into the 4-bytes
starting at address <span class="keyword">EBX</span>.  Since either
is a valid possible interpretation, the assembler must be explicitly
directed as to which is correct. The size prefixes <span class="keyword">b</span>, <span class="keyword">w</span>,
and <span class="keyword">l</span> serve this purpose,
indicating sizes of 1, 2, and 4 bytes respectively.

</p><p>
For example:

</p><blockquote>
<table>

<tbody><tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    movb $2, (%ebx)
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Move 2 into the single byte at the address
    stored in EBX. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    movw $2, (%ebx)
  </span></td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Move the 16-bit integer representation
    of 2 into the 2 bytes starting at the address in EBX. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><span class="keyword">
    movl $2, (%ebx) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
  </td>
  <td><span class="comment">
    /* Move the 32-bit integer representation of 2 into the
    4 bytes starting at the address in EBX. */
  </span></td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>
Machine instructions generally fall into three categories: data
movement, arithmetic/logic, and control-flow. In this section, we will
look at important examples of x86 instructions from each category. This
section should not be considered an exhaustive list of x86 instructions,
but rather a useful subset.  For a complete list, see Intel's
instruction set reference.

</p><p>
We use the following notation:

</p><blockquote>
<table>

<tbody><tr>
<td><span class="keyword">
&lt;reg32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></td>
<td>Any
32-bit register (<span class="keyword">%eax</span>,
<span class="keyword">%ebx</span>,
<span class="keyword">%ecx</span>,
<span class="keyword">%edx</span>,
<span class="keyword">%esi</span>,
<span class="keyword">%edi</span>,
<span class="keyword">%esp</span>, or
<span class="keyword">%ebp</span>)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="keyword">
&lt;reg16&gt;</span></td>
<td>Any
16-bit register (<span class="keyword">%ax</span>,
<span class="keyword">%bx</span>,
<span class="keyword">%cx</span>, or
<span class="keyword">%dx</span>)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="keyword">
&lt;reg8&gt;</span></td>
<td>Any
8-bit register (<span class="keyword">%ah</span>,
<span class="keyword">%bh</span>,
<span class="keyword">%ch</span>,
<span class="keyword">%dh</span>,

<span class="keyword">%bl</span>,
<span class="keyword">%cl</span>, or
<span class="keyword">%dl</span>)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="keyword">
&lt;reg&gt;</span></td>
<td>Any register</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><span class="keyword">

<tr>
<td><span class="keyword">
&lt;con&gt;</span></td>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
In assembly language, all the labels and numeric constants used as immediate operands
(i.e. not in an address calculation like <span class="keyword">3(%eax,%ebx,8)</span>)
are always prefixed by a dollar sign.  When needed, hexadecimal notation can
be used with the <span class="keyword">0x</span> prefix
(e.g. <span class="keyword">$0xABC</span>).  Without the prefix, numbers are
interpreted in the decimal basis.

</p><h3>Data Movement Instructions</h3>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>mov</b></span> — Move
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">mov</span> instruction copies the data item referred to by
its first operand (i.e. register contents, memory contents, or a constant
value) into the location referred to by its second operand (i.e. a register or
memory). While register-to-register moves are possible, direct memory-to-memory
moves are not. In cases where memory transfers are desired, the source memory
contents must first be loaded into a register, then can be stored to the
destination memory address.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">mov &lt;reg&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">mov &lt;reg&gt;, &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">mov &lt;mem&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">mov &lt;con&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">mov &lt;con&gt;, &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
<span class="keyword">mov %ebx, %eax</span> — copy the value in EBX into EAX<br>
<span class="keyword">movb $5, var(,1)</span> — store the value 5 into the
byte at location var<br>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>push</b></span> — Push on stack
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">push</span> instruction places its operand onto
the top of the hardware supported stack in memory. Specifically, <span class="keyword">push</span> first decrements ESP by 4, then places its
operand into the contents of the 32-bit location at address <span class="keyword">(%esp)</span>. ESP
(the stack pointer) is decremented by push since the x86 stack grows
down — i.e. the stack grows from high addresses to lower addresses.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">push &lt;reg32&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">push &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">push &lt;con32&gt;</span>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
<span class="keyword">push %eax</span> — push eax on the stack<br>
<span class="keyword">push var(,1)</span> — push the 4 bytes at
address <em>var</em> onto the stack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>pop</b></span> — Pop from stack
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">pop</span> instruction removes the 4-byte data
element from the top of the hardware-supported stack into the specified
operand (i.e. register or memory location). It first moves the 4 bytes
located at memory location <span class="keyword">(%esp)</span> into the
specified register or memory location, and then increments ESP by 4.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">pop &lt;reg32&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">pop &lt;mem&gt;</span>
</p><p></p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
<span class="keyword">pop %edi</span> — pop the top element of the stack into EDI.<br>
<span class="keyword">pop (%ebx)</span> — pop the top element of the
stack into memory at the four bytes starting at location EBX.
</blockquote>

<!--- not so useful -->
<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>lea</b></span> — Load effective address
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">lea</span> instruction places the <em>address</em> specified by its first operand
into the register specified by its second operand.
Note, the <em>contents</em> of the memory location are not
loaded, only the effective address is computed and placed into the register.
This is useful for obtaining a pointer into a memory region or to perform simple
arithmetic operations.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">lea &lt;mem&gt;, &lt;reg32&gt;</span><br>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
<span class="keyword">lea (%ebx,%esi,8), %edi</span> — the quantity EBX+8*ESI is placed in EDI.<br>
<span class="keyword">lea val(,1), %eax</span> — the value <em>val</em> is placed in EAX.
</p></blockquote>

<h3>Arithmetic and Logic Instructions</h3>

<span class="keyword"><b>add</b></span> — Integer addition
<blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">add</span> instruction adds
together its two operands, storing the result in its second
operand. Note, whereas both operands may be registers, at most one
operand may be a memory location.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">add &lt;reg&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">add &lt;mem&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">add &lt;reg&gt;, &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">add &lt;con&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">add &lt;con&gt;, &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
<span class="keyword">add $10, %eax</span> — EAX is set to EAX + 10<br>
<span class="keyword">addb $10, (%eax)</span> — add 10 to the
single byte stored at memory address stored in EAX
</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>sub</b></span> — Integer subtraction
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">sub</span> instruction stores in the value of
its second operand the result of subtracting the value of its first
operand from the value of its second operand.  As with <span class="keyword">add</span>, whereas both operands may be registers, at most
one operand may be a memory location.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">sub &lt;reg&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">sub &lt;mem&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">sub &lt;reg&gt;, &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">sub &lt;con&gt;, &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">sub &lt;con&gt;, &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
<span class="keyword">sub %ah, %al</span> — AL is set to AL - AH<br>
<span class="keyword">sub $216, %eax</span> — subtract 216 from the
value stored in EAX
</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>inc, dec</b></span> — Increment, Decrement
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">inc</span> instruction increments
the contents of its operand by one.  The <span class="keyword">dec</span>
instruction decrements the contents of its operand by one.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">inc &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">inc &lt;mem&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">dec &lt;reg&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">dec &lt;mem&gt;</span>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
<span class="keyword">dec %eax</span> — subtract one from the contents of EAX<br>
<span class="keyword">incl var(,1)</span> — add one to the
32-bit integer stored at location <em>var</em>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>imul</b></span> — Integer multiplication
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">imul</span> instruction has two basic formats:
two-operand (first two syntax listings above) and three-operand (last
two syntax listings above).
<p>
The two-operand form multiplies its two operands together and stores the result
in the second operand. The result (i.e. second) operand must be a
register.
</p><p>
The three operand form multiplies its second and third operands together
and stores the result in its last operand. Again, the result operand
must be a register. Furthermore, the first operand is restricted to
being a constant value.
</p><p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">imul &lt;reg32&gt;, &lt;reg32&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">imul &lt;mem&gt;, &lt;reg32&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">imul &lt;con&gt;, &lt;reg32&gt;, &lt;reg32&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">imul &lt;con&gt;, &lt;mem&gt;, &lt;reg32&gt;</span>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em><br>
</p><div class="hanging">
<span class="keyword">imul (%ebx), %eax</span> — multiply the contents
of EAX by the 32-bit contents of the memory at location EBX. Store
the result in EAX.
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<span class="keyword">imul $25, %edi, %esi</span> — ESI is set to EDI * 25
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>idiv</b></span> — Integer division
</p><blockquote>
The <span class="keyword">idiv</span> instruction divides the
contents of the 64 bit integer EDX:EAX (constructed by viewing EDX as
the most significant four bytes and EAX as the least significant four
bytes) by the specified operand value. The quotient result of the
division is stored into EAX, while the remainder is placed in EDX.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">idiv &lt;reg32&gt;</span><br>
<span class="keyword">idiv &lt;mem&gt;</span>
</p><p>
<em>Examples</em>
</p><div class="hanging">
<span class="keyword">idiv %ebx</span> — divide the contents of
EDX:EAX by the contents of EBX. Place the quotient in EAX and the
remainder in EDX.</div>
<div class="hanging"><span class="keyword">idivw (%ebx)</span> — divide the
contents of EDX:EAS by the 32-bit value stored at the memory location in
EBX. Place the quotient in EAX and the remainder in EDX.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>and, or, xor</b></span> — Bitwise logical
and, or, and exclusive or
</p><blockquote>
These instructions perform the specified logical operation (logical
bitwise and, or, and exclusive or, respectively) on their operands, placing the
result in the first operand location.

<h3>Control Flow Instructions</h3>

<p>
The x86 processor maintains an instruction pointer (EIP) register that is
a 32-bit value indicating the location in memory where the current
instruction starts.   Normally, it increments to point to the next
instruction in memory begins after execution an instruction.  The EIP
register cannot be manipulated directly, but is updated implicitly by
provided control flow instructions.

</p><p>
We use the notation <span class="keyword">&lt;label&gt;</span> to refer to
labeled locations in the program text.  Labels can be inserted anywhere
in x86 assembly code text by entering a label
name followed by a colon.  For example,

</p><blockquote>
<pre>       mov 8(%ebp), %esi
begin:
       xor %ecx, %ecx
       mov (%esi), %eax
</pre>
</blockquote>

The second instruction in this code fragment is labeled <span class="keyword">begin</span>. Elsewhere in the code, we can refer to the
memory location that this instruction is located at in memory using the
more convenient symbolic name <span class="keyword">begin</span>.  This
label is just a convenient way of expressing the location instead of its
32-bit value.

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>jmp</b></span> — Jump
</p><blockquote>
Transfers program control flow to the instruction at the memory
location indicated by the operand.
<p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">jmp &lt;label&gt;</span>
</p><p>
<em>Example</em><br>
<span class="keyword">jmp begin</span> — Jump to the instruction
labeled <span class="keyword">begin</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>j<em>condition</em></b></span> — Conditional jump
</p><blockquote>
These instructions are conditional jumps that are based on the status of
a set of condition codes that are stored in a special register called
the <em>machine status word</em>. The contents of the machine status
word include information about the last arithmetic operation
performed. For example, one bit of this word indicates if the last
result was zero. Another indicates if the last result was
negative. Based on these condition codes, a number of conditional jumps
can be performed. For example, the <span class="keyword">jz</span>
instruction performs a jump to the specified operand label if the result
of the last arithmetic operation was zero. Otherwise, control proceeds
to the next instruction in sequence.
<p>
A number of the conditional branches are given names that are
intuitively based on the last operation performed being a special
compare instruction, <span class="keyword">cmp</span> (see below). For example, conditional branches
such as <span class="keyword">jle</span> and <span class="keyword">jne</span> are based on first performing a cmp operation
on the desired operands.

</p><p>
<em>Syntax</em><br>
<span class="keyword">je &lt;label&gt;</span> (jump when equal)<br>
<span class="keyword">jne &lt;label&gt;</span> (jump when not equal)<br>
<span class="keyword">jz &lt;label&gt;</span> (jump when last result was zero)<br>
<span class="keyword">jg &lt;label&gt;</span> (jump when greater than)<br>
<span class="keyword">jge &lt;label&gt;</span> (jump when greater than or equal to)<br>
<span class="keyword">jl &lt;label&gt;</span> (jump when less than)<br>
<span class="keyword">jle &lt;label&gt;</span> (jump when less than or equal to)

</p><pre>cmp %ebx, %eax
jle done
</pre>
<div class="explanation">
If the contents of EAX are less than or equal to the contents of EBX,
jump to the label <em>done</em>.  Otherwise, continue to the next
instruction.

</blockquote>

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>cmp</b></span> — Compare
</p><blockquote>
Compare the values of the two specified operands, setting the condition
codes in the machine status word appropriately.  This instruction is
equivalent to the <span class="keyword">sub</span> instruction, except the
result of the subtraction is discarded instead of replacing the first
operand.

<p>
<span class="keyword"><b>call</b>, <b>ret</b></span> — Subroutine call and return
</p><blockquote>
These instructions implement a subroutine call and return.
The <span class="keyword">call</span> instruction first pushes the current

operand. Unlike the simple jump instructions, the <span class="keyword">call</span> instruction saves the location to return to
when the subroutine completes.
<p>
The <span class="keyword">ret</span> instruction implements a subroutine
return mechanism. This instruction first pops a code location off the
hardware supported in-memory stack (see the <span class="keyword">pop</span> instruction for details). It then performs an
unconditional jump to the retrieved code location.

<h2 id="calling">Calling Convention</h2>

<p>
To allow separate programmers to share code and develop libraries for
use by many programs, and to simplify the use of subroutines in general,
programmers typically adopt a common <em>calling convention</em>. The
calling convention is a protocol about how to call and return from
routines.  For example, given a set of calling convention rules, a
programmer need not examine the definition of a subroutine to determine
how parameters should be passed to that subroutine. Furthermore, given a
set of calling convention rules, high-level language compilers can be
made to follow the rules, thus allowing hand-coded assembly language
routines and high-level language routines to call one another.

</p><p>
In practice, many calling conventions are possible.  We will describe the
widely used C language calling convention. Following this convention
will allow you to write assembly language subroutines that are safely
callable from C (and C++) code, and will also enable you to call C
library functions from your assembly language code.

</p><p>
The C calling convention is based heavily on the use of the
hardware-supported stack. It is based on the <span class="keyword">push</span>, <span class="keyword">pop</span>, <span class="keyword">call</span>, and <span class="keyword">ret</span>
instructions.  Subroutine parameters are passed on the stack. Registers
are saved on the stack, and local variables used by subroutines are
placed in memory on the stack. The vast majority of high-level
procedural languages implemented on most processors have used similar
calling conventions.

</p><p>
The calling convention is broken into two sets of rules. The first set
of rules is employed by the caller of the subroutine, and the second set
of rules is observed by the writer of the subroutine (the callee). It
should be emphasized that mistakes in the observance of these rules
quickly result in fatal program errors since the stack will be left in
an inconsistent state; thus  meticulous care should be used when
implementing the call convention in your own subroutines.

</p><p>

<b>Stack during Subroutine Call</b> <br>
<div style="color: blue; font-size: 8pt">
[Thanks to James Peterson for finding and fixing the bug in
the original version of this figure!]</div>
</div>

<p>
A good way to visualize the operation of the calling convention is to
draw the contents of the nearby region of the stack during subroutine
execution.  The image above depicts the contents of the stack during the
execution of a subroutine with three parameters and three local
variables.  The cells depicted in the stack
are 32-bit wide memory locations, thus the memory addresses of the cells
are 4 bytes apart. The first
parameter resides at an offset of 8 bytes from the base pointer. Above
the parameters on the stack (and below the base pointer), the <span class="keyword">call</span> instruction placed the return address, thus
leading to an extra 4 bytes of offset from the base pointer to the first
parameter.  When the <span class="keyword">ret</span> instruction is used
to return from the subroutine, it will jump to the return address stored
on the stack.


</p><h3>Caller Rules</h3>

<p>
To make a subrouting call, the caller should:
</p><ol>
<li> Before calling a subroutine, the caller should
save the contents of certain registers that are designated
<em>caller-saved</em>.  The caller-saved registers are EAX, ECX, EDX.
Since the called subroutine is allowed to modify these registers, if the
caller relies on their values after the subroutine returns, the caller
must push the values in these registers onto the stack (so they can be
restore after the subroutine returns.

</li><li> To pass parameters to the subroutine, push them onto the stack
before the call. The parameters should be pushed in inverted order
(i.e. last parameter first).  Since the stack grows down, the first
parameter will be stored at the lowest address (this inversion of
parameters was historically used to allow functions to be passed a
variable number of parameters).

</li><li> To call the subroutine, use the <span class="keyword">call</span>
instruction. This instruction places the return address on top of the
parameters on the stack, and branches to the subroutine code.  This
invokes the subroutine, which should follow the callee rules below.
</li></ol>

<p>
After the subroutine returns (immediately following the <span class="keyword">call</span> instruction), the caller can expect to find
the return value of the subroutine in the register EAX.  To restore the
machine state, the caller should:

</p><ol>
<li> Remove the parameters from stack. This restores the stack to its
state before the call was performed.

</li><li> Restore the contents of caller-saved registers (EAX, ECX, EDX) by
popping them off of the stack. The caller can assume that no other
registers were modified by the subroutine.
</li></ol>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>
The code below shows a function call that follows the caller rules.  The
caller is calling a function <em>myFunc</em> that takes three integer
parameters. First parameter is in EAX, the second parameter is the
constant 216; the third  parameter is in the memory location stored in EBX.

</p><blockquote>
<pre>push (%ebx)    /* Push last parameter first */
push $216      /* Push the second parameter */
push %eax      /* Push first parameter last */

call myFunc    /* Call the function (assume C naming) */

add $12, %esp
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that after the call returns, the caller cleans up the stack using
the <span class="keyword">add</span> instruction. We have 12 bytes (3
parameters * 4 bytes each) on the stack, and the stack grows down. Thus,
to get rid of the parameters, we can simply add 12 to the stack pointer.

</p><p>
The result produced by <em>myFunc</em> is now available for use in the
register EAX.  The values of the caller-saved registers (ECX and EDX),
may have been changed.  If the caller uses them after the call, it would
have needed to save them on the stack before the call and restore them
after it.

</p><h3>Callee Rules</h3>

<p>
The definition of the subroutine should adhere to the following rules at
the beginning of the subroutine:
</p><ol>
<li> Push the value of EBP onto the stack, and then copy the value of ESP
into EBP using the following instructions:

<pre>    push %ebp
    mov  %esp, %ebp
</pre>

This initial action maintains the <em>base pointer</em>, EBP. The base
pointer is used by convention as a point of reference for finding
parameters and local variables on the stack. When a subroutine is
executing, the base pointer holds a copy of the stack pointer value from
when the subroutine started executing. Parameters and local variables
will always be located at known, constant offsets away from the base
pointer value. We push the old base pointer value at the beginning of
the subroutine so that we can later restore the appropriate base pointer
value for the caller when the subroutine returns.  Remember, the caller
is not expecting the subroutine to change the value of the base
pointer. We then move the stack pointer into EBP to obtain our point of
reference for accessing parameters and local variables.

</li><li> Next, allocate local variables by making space on the
stack. Recall, the stack grows down, so to make space on the top of the
stack, the stack pointer should be decremented. The amount by which the stack
pointer is decremented depends on the number and size of local variables
needed. For example, if 3 local integers (4 bytes each) were required,
the stack pointer would need to be decremented by 12 to make space for
these local variables (i.e., <span class="keyword">sub&nbsp;$12,&nbsp;%esp</span>).
As with parameters, local variables will be located at known offsets
from the base pointer.

</li><li> Next, save the values of the <em>callee-saved</em> registers that
will be used by the function. To save registers, push them onto the
stack. The callee-saved registers are EBX, EDI, and ESI (ESP and EBP
will also be preserved by the calling convention, but need not be pushed
on the stack during this step).
</li></ol>

<p>
After these three actions are performed, the body of the
subroutine may proceed. When the subroutine is returns, it must follow
these steps:

</p><ol>
<li> Leave the return value in EAX.
</li><li> Restore the old values of any callee-saved registers (EDI and ESI)
that were modified. The register contents are restored by popping them
from the stack.  The registers should be popped in the inverse
order that they were pushed.
</li><li> Deallocate local variables. The obvious way to do this might be to
add the appropriate value to the stack pointer (since the space was
allocated by subtracting the needed amount from the stack pointer). In
practice, a less error-prone way to deallocate the variables is to
move the value in the base pointer into the stack pointer: <span class="keyword">mov&nbsp;%ebp,&nbsp;%esp</span>.  This works because the
base pointer always contains the value that the stack pointer contained immediately
prior to the allocation of the local variables.
</li><li> Immediately before returning, restore the caller's base pointer
value by popping EBP off the stack. Recall that the first thing we did on
entry to the subroutine was to push the base pointer to save its old
value.
</li><li> Finally, return to the caller by executing a <span class="keyword">ret</span> instruction. This instruction will find and
remove the appropriate return address from the stack.
</li></ol>

<p>
Note that the callee's rules fall cleanly into two halves that are
basically mirror images of one another. The first half of the rules
apply to the beginning of the function, and are commonly said
to define the <em>prologue</em> to the function. The latter half of the
rules apply to the end of the function, and are thus commonly said to
define the <em>epilogue</em> of the function.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>
Here is an example function definition that follows the callee rules:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>  /* Start the code section */
  .text

  /* Define myFunc as a global (exported) function. */
  .globl myFunc
  .type myFunc, @function
myFunc:

  /* Subroutine Prologue */
  push %ebp      /* Save the old base pointer value. */
  mov %esp, %ebp /* Set the new base pointer value. */
  sub $4, %esp   /* Make room for one 4-byte local variable. */
  push %edi      /* Save the values of registers that the function */
  push %esi      /* will modify. This function uses EDI and ESI. */
  /* (no need to save EBX, EBP, or ESP) */

  /* Subroutine Body */
  mov 8(%ebp), %eax   /* Move value of parameter 1 into EAX. */
  mov 12(%ebp), %esi  /* Move value of parameter 2 into ESI. */
  mov 16(%ebp), %edi  /* Move value of parameter 3 into EDI. */

  mov %edi, -4(%ebp)  /* Move EDI into the local variable. */
  add %esi, -4(%ebp)  /* Add ESI into the local variable. */
  add -4(%ebp), %eax  /* Add the contents of the local variable */
                      /* into EAX (final result). */

  /* Subroutine Epilogue */
  pop %esi       /* Recover register values. */
  pop %edi
  mov %ebp, %esp /* Deallocate the local variable. */
  pop %ebp       /* Restore the caller's base pointer value. */
  ret
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The subroutine prologue performs the standard actions of saving a
snapshot of the stack pointer in EBP (the base pointer), allocating
local variables by decrementing the stack pointer, and saving register
values on the stack.

</p><p>
In the body of the subroutine we can see the use of the base
pointer. Both parameters and local variables are located at constant
offsets from the base pointer for the duration of the subroutines
execution. In particular, we notice that since parameters were placed
onto the stack before the subroutine was called, they are always located
below the base pointer (i.e. at higher addresses) on the stack. The
first parameter to the subroutine can always be found at memory location
(EBP+8), the second at (EBP+12), the third at (EBP+16).  Similarly,
since local variables are allocated after the base pointer is set, they
always reside above the base pointer (i.e. at lower addresses) on the
stack. In particular, the first local variable is always located at
(EBP-4), the second at (EBP-8), and so on. This conventional use of the
base pointer allows us to quickly identify the use of local variables
and parameters within a function body.

</p><p>
The function epilogue is basically a mirror image of the function
prologue. The caller's register values  are recovered from the stack,
the local variables are deallocated by resetting the stack pointer, the
caller's base pointer value is recovered, and the ret instruction is
used to return to the appropriate code location in the caller.
