<p>We are here to learn about GCC inline assembly. What this inline stands for?
</p><p>
</p><p>We can instruct the compiler to insert the code of a function into the code 
of its callers, to the point where actually the call is to be made. Such 
functions are inline functions. Sounds similar to a Macro? Indeed there are 
similarities.
</p><p>
</p><p>What is the benefit of inline functions? 
</p><p>
</p><p>This method of inlining reduces the function-call overhead. And if any of the 
actual argument values are constant, their known values may permit 
simplifications at compile time so that not all of the inline function’s code 
needs to be included.  The  effect on code size is less predictable, it depends
on the particular case. To declare an inline function, we’ve to use the keyword 
<code>inline</code> in its declaration.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now we are in a position to guess what is inline assembly. Its just some 
assembly routines written as inline functions. They are handy, speedy and very 
much useful in system programming. Our main focus is to study the basic format 
and usage of (GCC) inline assembly functions. To declare inline assembly 
functions, we use the keyword <code>asm</code>.
</p><p>
</p><p>Inline  assembly  is  important  primarily  because  of its ability to operate
and make its output visible on C variables. Because  of this capability, "asm" 
works as an interface between the assembly instructions and the "C" 
program that contains it.
</p><p>

<h2><a name="s3">3.</a> <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html#toc3">GCC Assembler Syntax.</a></h2>

<p> GCC, the GNU C Compiler for Linux, uses <b>AT&amp;T</b>/<b>UNIX</b> 
assembly syntax. Here we’ll be using AT&amp;T syntax for assembly coding. Don’t 
worry if you are not familiar with AT&amp;T syntax, I will teach you. This is 
quite different from Intel syntax. I shall give the major differences. 
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Source-Destination Ordering.

<p> The  direction  of the operands in AT&amp;T syntax is opposite to that of 
Intel. In Intel syntax the first operand is the  destination, and the second 
operand is the source whereas in AT&amp;T syntax the first operand is the source
and the second operand is the destination. ie, 
</p><p>
</p><p> "Op-code dst src" in Intel syntax changes to 
</p><p>
</p><p> "Op-code src dst" in AT&amp;T syntax.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li>Register Naming.

<p> Register names are prefixed by % ie, if eax is to be used, write %eax.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li>Immediate Operand.

<p>AT&amp;T  immediate  operands are preceded by ’$’. For static "C" 
variables also prefix a ’$’. In Intel syntax, for 
hexadecimal constants an ’h’ is suffixed, instead of that, here we prefix ’0x’ 
to the constant. So, for hexadecimals, we first see a ’$’, then ’0x’ 
and finally the constants.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li>Operand Size.

<p>In  AT&amp;T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the last 
character of the op-code name. Op-code suffixes  of  ’b’, ’w’, 
and ’l’ specify  byte(8-bit), word(16-bit), and 
long(32-bit) memory references. Intel syntax accomplishes this by prefixing 
memory operands (not the op-codes) with ’byte ptr’, ’word ptr’, and ’dword ptr’. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Thus, Intel "mov al, byte ptr foo"  is "movb foo, %al" 
in AT&amp;T syntax.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li>Memory Operands.

<p>In Intel syntax the base register is enclosed in ’[’ and ’]’ where 
as in AT&amp;T they change to ’(’ and ’)’. Additionally, in Intel syntax an 
indirect memory reference is like 
</p><p>
</p><p>section:[base + index*scale + disp], which 
changes to
</p><p>
</p><p>section:disp(base, index, scale) in AT&amp;T. 
</p><p>
</p><p>One point to bear in mind is that, when a constant is used for 
disp/scale, ’$’ shouldn’t be prefixed.
</p><p>
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now we saw some of the major differences between Intel syntax and AT&amp;T 
syntax. I’ve wrote only a few of them. For a complete information, refer to GNU 
Assembler documentations. Now we’ll look at some examples for better 
understanding.
</p><blockquote><code>

| mov     eax,1                |  movl    $1,%eax                   |

<h2><a name="s4">4.</a> <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html#toc4">Basic Inline.</a></h2>

<p>The format of basic inline assembly is very much straight forward. Its basic 
form is
</p><p>
</p><p><code>asm("assembly code");</code>
</p><p>
</p><p>Example.
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>asm("movl %ecx %eax"); /* moves the contents of ecx to eax */
__asm__("movb %bh (%eax)"); /*moves the byte from bh to the memory pointed by eax */
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p> You might have noticed that here I’ve used <code>asm</code> and <code>__asm__</code>. Both 
are valid. We can use <code>__asm__</code> if the keyword <code>asm</code> conflicts with 
something in our program. If we have more than one instructions, we write one per 
line in double quotes, and also suffix a ’\n’ and ’\t’ to the 
instruction. This is because gcc sends each instruction as a string to <b>as</b>(GAS) and 
by using the newline/tab we send correctly formatted lines to the assembler.
</p><p>
</p><p>Example.
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre> __asm__ ("movl %eax, %ebx\n\t"
          "movl $56, %esi\n\t"
          "movl %ecx, $label(%edx,%ebx,$4)\n\t"
          "movb %ah, (%ebx)");
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p> If in our code we touch (ie, change the contents) some registers and return 
from asm without fixing 
those changes, something bad is going to happen. This is because GCC have no 
idea about the changes in the register contents and this leads us to trouble, 
especially when compiler makes some optimizations. It will suppose that some 
register contains the value of some variable that we might have changed 
without informing GCC, and it continues like nothing happened. What we can do 
is either use those instructions having no side effects or fix things when we 
quit or wait for something to crash. This is where we want some extended 
functionality. Extended asm provides us with that functionality.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="s5">5.</a> <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html#toc5">Extended Asm.</a></h2>

<p>In basic inline assembly, we had only instructions. In extended assembly, 
we can also specify the operands. It allows us to specify the input registers,
output registers and a list of clobbered registers. It is not mandatory to  
specify the registers to use, we can leave that head ache to GCC and
that probably fit into GCC’s optimization scheme better. Anyway the 
basic format is:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>       asm ( assembler template 
           : output operands                  /* optional */
           : input operands                   /* optional */
           : list of clobbered registers      /* optional */
           );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The  assembler  template  consists  of  assembly instructions. Each  
operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by the  C  
expression  in  parentheses.  A  colon separates the assembler template  
from the first output operand and another separates the last output  operand 
from  the  first  input,  if any. Commas separate the operands within each 
group. The total number of operands is limited to ten or to the maximum number 
of operands in any instruction pattern in the machine description, whichever 
is greater.
</p><p>
</p><p>If there are no output operands but there are input operands, you must
place  two  consecutive  colons surrounding the place where the output
operands would go.
</p><p>
</p><p>Example:
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>        asm ("cld\n\t"
             "rep\n\t"
             "stosl"
             : /* no output registers */
             : "c" (count), "a" (fill_value), "D" (dest)
             : "%ecx", "%edi" 
             );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Now, what does this code do? The above inline fills the <code>fill_value</code> 
<code>count</code> times to the location pointed to by the register <code>edi</code>. It 
also says to gcc that, the contents of registers <code>eax</code> and <code>edi</code> are no 
longer valid. Let us see one more example to make things more clearer.
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>        
        int a=10, b;
        asm ("movl %1, %%eax; 
              movl %%eax, %0;"
             :"=r"(b)        /* output */
             :"r"(a)         /* input */
             :"%eax"         /* clobbered register */
             );       
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Here what we did is we made the value of ’b’ equal to that of ’a’ using
assembly instructions. Some points of interest are:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>"b" is the output operand, referred to by %0 and "a" is the input 
operand, referred to by %1.
</li>
<li>"r" is a constraint on the operands. We’ll see constraints in detail 
later. For the time being, "r" says to GCC to use any register for storing the 
operands. output  operand constraint should have a constraint modifier "=".
And this modifier says that it is the output operand and is write-only.
</li>
<li>There are two %’s prefixed to the register name. This helps GCC to 
distinguish between the operands and registers. operands have a single % as 
prefix.
</li>
<li>The  clobbered  register %eax after the third colon tells GCC that the 
value of %eax is to be modified inside "asm", so GCC won’t use this register 
to store any other value.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>When  the  execution  of  "asm"  is complete, "b" will reflect the updated  
value,  as it is specified as an output operand. In other words, the change  
made  to  "b"  inside "asm" is supposed to be reflected outside the "asm".
</p><p>
</p><p>Now we may look each field in detail.
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss5.1">5.1 Assembler Template.</a>
</h2>

<p>The assembler template contains the set of assembly instructions that gets 
inserted inside the C program. The format is like: either each instruction 
should be enclosed within double quotes, or the entire group of instructions 
should be within  double  quotes. Each instruction should also end with a 
delimiter. The valid delimiters are newline(\n) and semicolon(;). ’\n’ 
may  be  followed by a tab(\t). We know the reason of 
newline/tab, right?. Operands corresponding to the C expressions are 
represented by %0, %1 ... etc. 
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss5.2">5.2 Operands.</a>
</h2>

<p>C  expressions  serve as operands for the assembly instructions inside 
"asm". Each operand is written as first an operand constraint in double 
quotes. For output operands, there’ll be a constraint modifier also within the 
quotes and then follows the C expression which stands for the operand. ie,
</p><p>
</p><p> "constraint" (C expression) is the general form. For output operands an 
additional modifier will be there. Constraints are primarily used to decide 
the addressing modes for operands. They are also used in specifying the 
registers to be used.
</p><p>
</p><p>If we use more than one operand, they are separated by comma.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the assembler template, each operand is referenced by numbers. Numbering 
is done as follows. If there are a total of n operands 
(both input and output inclusive), 
then  the first output operand is numbered 0, continuing in increasing 
order, and the last input operand is numbered n-1. The maximum number of 
operands is as we saw in the previous section.
</p><p>
</p><p>Output  operand  expressions  must  be lvalues. The input operands are 
not restricted like this. They may be expressions. The extended asm feature 
is most often used for machine instructions the compiler itself does not know 
as existing ;-). If the output expression cannot be directly addressed 
(for example, it is a bit-field), our constraint must allow a register. 
In that case, GCC will use the register as the output of the asm, and then 
store that register contents into the output.
</p><p>
</p><p>As stated above, ordinary output operands must be write-only; GCC will 
assume that the  values in these operands before the instruction are dead 
and need not  be  generated.  Extended asm also supports input-output or 
read-write operands. 
</p><p>
</p><p>So now we concentrate on some examples. We want to multiply a number by 5.
For that we use the instruction <code>lea</code>. 
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>        asm ("leal (%1,%1,4), %0"
             : "=r" (five_times_x)
             : "r" (x) 
             );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Here our input is in ’x’. We didn’t specify the register to be used. GCC 
will choose some register for input, one for output and does what we desired.
If we want the input and output to reside in the same register, we can 
instruct GCC to do so. Here we use those types of read-write operands. By 
specifying proper constraints, here we do it.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>        asm ("leal (%0,%0,4), %0"
             : "=r" (five_times_x)
             : "0" (x) 
             );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Now the input and output operands are in the same register. But we don’t 
know which register. Now if we want to specify that also, there is a way.
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>        asm ("leal (%%ecx,%%ecx,4), %%ecx"
             : "=c" (x)
             : "c" (x) 
             );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p> In all the three examples above, we didn’t put any register to the clobber 
list. why? In the first two examples, GCC decides the registers and it knows 
what changes happen. In the last one, we don’t have to put <code>ecx</code> on the c
lobberlist, gcc knows it  goes into x. Therefore, since it can know the value 
of <code>ecx</code>, it isn’t considered clobbered.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss5.3">5.3 Clobber List.</a>
</h2>

<p>Some instructions clobber some hardware registers. We have to list those 
registers in the clobber-list, ie the field after the third ’<b>:</b>’ in the 
asm function. This is to inform gcc that we will use and modify them 
ourselves. So gcc will not assume that the values it loads into these 
registers will be valid. We shoudn’t list the input and output registers in 
this list. Because, gcc knows that "asm" uses them 
(because they are specified explicitly as constraints). 
If the instructions use any  other  registers, implicitly or explicitly 
(and the registers are not  present  either  in input or in the output 
constraint list), then those registers have to be specified in the
clobbered list. 
</p><p>
</p><p>If our instruction can alter the condition code register, we have to add 
"cc" to the list of clobbered registers.
</p><p>
</p><p>If our instruction  modifies  memory in an unpredictable fashion,  add  
"memory" to the list of clobbered registers. This will cause GCC to not keep 
memory values cached in registers across the assembler instruction. We also 
have to add the <b>volatile</b> keyword if the memory affected is not listed 
in the inputs or outputs of the asm. 
</p><p>
</p><p>We can read and write the clobbered registers as many times as we like. 
Consider the example of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes the 
subroutine _foo accepts arguments in registers <code>eax</code> and <code>ecx</code>.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>        asm ("movl %0,%%eax;
              movl %1,%%ecx;
              call _foo"
             : /* no outputs */
             : "g" (from), "g" (to)
             : "eax", "ecx"
             );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h2><a name="ss5.4">5.4 Volatile ...?</a>
</h2>

<p>If you are familiar with kernel sources or some beautiful code like that, 
you must have seen many functions declared as <code>volatile</code> or 
<code>__volatile__</code> which follows an <code>asm</code> or <code>__asm__</code>. I mentioned 
earlier about the keywords <code>asm</code> and <code>__asm__</code>. So what is this 
<code>volatile</code>? 
</p><p>
</p><p>If our assembly statement must execute where we put it, 
(i.e. must not be moved out of a loop as an optimization), put the keyword  
<code>volatile</code>  after asm and before the ()’s. So to keep it from moving, 
deleting and all, we declare it as
</p><p><code>asm volatile ( ... : ... : ... : ...);</code>
</p><p>
</p><p>Use <code>__volatile__</code> when we have to be verymuch careful.

</p><p>If our assembly is just for doing some calculations and doesn’t have any 
side effects, it’s better not to use the keyword <code>volatile</code>. Avoiding it 
helps gcc in optimizing the code and making it more beautiful.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the section <code>Some Useful Recipes</code>, I have provided many examples for inline asm 
functions. There we can see the clobber-list in detail.

<h2><a name="s6">6.</a> <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html#toc6">More about constraints.</a></h2>

<p>By this time, you might have understood that constraints have got a lot to 
do with inline assembly. But we’ve said little about constraints. Constraints 
can say whether an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register;
whether the operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of address; 
whether the operand may be an immediate constant, and which possible values (ie range of values)
it may have.... etc. 
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss6.1">6.1 Commonly used constraints.</a>
</h2>

<p>There are a number of constraints of which only a few are used frequently. 
We’ll have a look at those constraints.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><b>Register operand constraint(r)</b>

<p>When  operands are specified using this constraint, they get stored 
in General Purpose Registers(GPR). Take the following example:
</p><p>
</p><p><code> asm ("movl %%eax, %0\n" :"=r"(myval)); </code>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here  the  variable myval is kept in a register, the value in register 
<code>eax</code> is copied onto that register, and the value of <code>myval</code> is 
updated into the memory  from  this register. When the "r" constraint is 
specified, gcc may  keep the variable in any of the available GPRs. 
To specify the  register,  you  must directly specify the register names by 
using specific register constraints. They are:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<pre>+---+--------------------+
| r |    Register(s)     |
+---+--------------------+
| a |   %eax, %ax, %al   |
| b |   %ebx, %bx, %bl   |
| c |   %ecx, %cx, %cl   |
| d |   %edx, %dx, %dl   |
| S |   %esi, %si        |
| D |   %edi, %di        |
+---+--------------------+
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p></li>
<li><b>Memory operand constraint(m)</b>

<p> When  the operands are in the memory, any operations performed on 
them will  occur  directly  in  the memory location, as opposed to register 
constraints, which first store the value in a register to be modified and 
then  write  it  back  to  the  memory  location.  But  register constraints  
are  usually used only when they are absolutely necessary for an instruction 
or they significantly speed up the process. Memory constraints  can  be used 
most efficiently in cases where a C variable needs to be updated inside "asm" 
and you really don’t want to use a register to hold its value. For example, 
the value of idtr is stored in the memory location loc:
</p><p><code>asm("sidt %0\n" : :"m"(loc));</code>
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>Matching(Digit) constraints</b>

<p>In  some  cases, a single variable may serve as both the input and the
output operand. Such cases may be specified in "asm" by using matching
constraints. 
</p><p><code> asm ("incl %0" :"=a"(var):"0"(var));</code>
</p><p>
</p><p>We saw similar examples in operands subsection also. In this example for 
matching constraints, the register %eax is used as both  the input and the 
output variable. var input is read to %eax and updated %eax is stored in var  
again  after  increment.  "0" here specifies the same constraint as the 0th 
output variable. That is, it specifies that the output instance of var should 
be stored in %eax only. This constraint can be used:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>In  cases  where  input is read from a variable or the variable is 
modified and modification is written back to the same variable.</li>
<li>In cases where separate instances of input and output operands are not 
necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p> The  most  important  effect of using matching restraints is that they
lead to the efficient use of available registers.
</p><p>
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p>Some other constraints used are:
</p><ol>
<li> "m" : A  memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address 
that the machine supports in general.</li>
<li> "o" : A  memory  operand  is  allowed,  but  only  if  the address 
is offsettable. ie, adding a small offset to the address gives a valid address.</li>
<li> "V" : A  memory  operand  that  is  not  offsettable. In other words, 
anything  that  would  fit  the  `m’ constraint but not the `o’constraint.</li>
<li> "i" : An  immediate  integer  operand  (one  with  constant value) 
is allowed.  This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known 
only at assembly time.</li>
<li> "n" : An  immediate  integer  operand  with  a known numeric value is 
allowed.  Many  systems  cannot support assembly-time constants for  operands  
less  than  a  word  wide. Constraints for these operands should use ’n’ 
rather than ’i’.</li>
<li> "g" : Any  register,  memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, 
except for registers that are not general registers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following constraints are x86 specific.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li> "r" : Register operand constraint, look table given above.</li>
<li> "q" : Registers a, b, c or d.</li>
<li> "I" : Constant in range 0 to 31 (for 32-bit shifts).</li>
<li> "J" : Constant in range 0 to 63 (for 64-bit shifts).</li>
<li> "K" : 0xff. </li>
<li> "L" : 0xffff.             </li>
<li> "M" : 0, 1, 2, or 3 (shifts for lea instruction).</li>
<li> "N" : Constant in range 0 to 255 (for out instruction).</li>
<li> "f" : Floating point register</li>
<li> "t" : First (top of stack) floating point register</li>
<li> "u" : Second floating point register</li>
<li> "A" : Specifies  the  `a’  or  `d’  registers. This is primarily useful 
for  64-bit integer values intended to be returned with  the  `d’  register 
holding the most significant bits and the `a’ register holding the least 
significant bits.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss6.2">6.2 Constraint Modifiers.</a>
</h2>

<p>While using constraints, for more precise control over the effects of 
constraints, GCC provides us with constraint modifiers. Mostly used constraint modifiers are 
</p><ol>
<li> "=" : Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction; 
the previous value is discarded and replaced by output data.</li>
<li> "&amp;" : Means that this operand is an earlyclobber  operand, 
which is modified before the instruction is  finished  using the input 
operands. Therefore, this operand may not lie in a register that is used as 
an input operand or as part of any memory address. An  input operand can be 
tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only use as an input occurs before the 
early result is written.

<p> The list and explanation of constraints is by no means complete. Examples can 
give a better understanding of the use and usage of inline asm. In the next section 
we’ll see some examples, there we’ll find more about clobber-lists and constraints.

<h2><a name="s7">7.</a> <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html#toc7">Some Useful Recipes.</a></h2>

<p>Now we have covered the basic theory about GCC inline assembly, now we 
shall concentrate on some simple examples. It is always handy to write inline
asm functions as MACRO’s. We can see many asm functions in the kernel code.
(/usr/src/linux/include/asm/*.h). 
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><p>First we start with a simple example. We’ll write a program to add two numbers.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>int main(void)
{
        int foo = 10, bar = 15;
        __asm__ __volatile__("addl  %%ebx,%%eax"
                             :"=a"(foo)
                             :"a"(foo), "b"(bar)
                             );
        printf("foo+bar=%d\n", foo);
        return 0;
}
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p> Here we insist GCC to store foo in %eax, bar in %ebx and we also want the 
result in %eax. The ’=’ sign shows that it is an output register. Now we can add 
an integer to a variable in some other way.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre> __asm__ __volatile__(
                      "   lock       ;\n"
                      "   addl %1,%0 ;\n"
                      : "=m"  (my_var)
                      : "ir"  (my_int), "m" (my_var)
                      :                                 /* no clobber-list */
                      );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p> This is an atomic addition. We can remove the instruction ’lock’ to 
remove the atomicity. In the output field, "=m" says that my_var is an output 
and it is in memory. Similarly, "ir" says that, my_int is an integer and should reside 
in some register (recall the table we saw above). No registers are in the clobber list.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><p> Now we’ll perform some action on some registers/variables and compare the value.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre> __asm__ __volatile__(  "decl %0; sete %1"
                      : "=m" (my_var), "=q" (cond)
                      : "m" (my_var) 
                      : "memory"
                      );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Here, the value of my_var is decremented by one and if the resulting value is <code>0</code>
then, the variable cond is set. We can add atomicity by adding an instruction "lock;\n\t"
as the first instruction in assembler template. 
</p><p>
</p><p> In a similar way we can use "incl %0" instead of "decl %0", so as to increment my_var.
</p><p>
</p><p>Points to note here are that (i) my_var is a variable residing in memory. 
(ii) cond is in any of the registers eax, ebx, ecx and edx. The constraint 
"=q" guarantees it. (iii) And we can see that memory is there in the clobber 
list. ie, the code is changing the contents of memory.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><p>How to set/clear a bit in a register? As next recipe, we are going to see it.
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>__asm__ __volatile__(   "btsl %1,%0"
                      : "=m" (ADDR)
                      : "Ir" (pos)
                      : "cc"
                      );
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Here, the bit at the position  ’pos’ of variable at ADDR ( a memory variable ) is set to <code>1</code>
We can use ’btrl’ for ’btsl’ to clear the bit. The constraint "Ir" of pos says that, pos is in a register, 
and it’s value ranges from 0-31 (x86 dependant constraint). ie, we can set/clear any bit from 0th to 31st 
of the variable at ADDR. As the condition codes will be changed, we are adding "cc" to clobberlist.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><p>Now we look at some more complicated but useful function. String copy.
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>static inline char * strcpy(char * dest,const char *src)
{
int d0, d1, d2;
__asm__ __volatile__(  "1:\tlodsb\n\t"
                       "stosb\n\t"
                       "testb %%al,%%al\n\t"
                       "jne 1b"
                     : "=&amp;S" (d0), "=&amp;D" (d1), "=&amp;a" (d2)
                     : "0" (src),"1" (dest) 
                     : "memory");
return dest;
}
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The source address is stored in esi, destination in edi, and then starts the 
copy, when we reach at <b>0</b>, copying is complete. Constraints "&amp;S", "&amp;D", "&amp;a"
say that the registers esi, edi and eax are early clobber registers, ie, their contents will
change before the completion of the function. Here also it’s clear that why memory is in clobberlist.
</p><p>
</p><p>We can see a similar function which moves a block of double words. Notice that the function 
is declared as a macro.
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>#define mov_blk(src, dest, numwords) \
__asm__ __volatile__ (                                          \
                       "cld\n\t"                                \
                       "rep\n\t"                                \
                       "movsl"                                  \
                       :                                        \
                       : "S" (src), "D" (dest), "c" (numwords)  \
                       : "%ecx", "%esi", "%edi"                 \
                       )
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>Here we have no outputs, so the changes that happen to the contents of the 
registers ecx, esi and edi are side effects of the block movement. So we have 
to add them to the clobber list.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li> 

<p>In Linux, system calls are implemented using GCC inline assembly. Let us look how a system call is implemented.
All the system calls are written as macros (linux/unistd.h). For example, a system call with three arguments is 
defined as a macro as shown below. 
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>#define _syscall3(type,name,type1,arg1,type2,arg2,type3,arg3) \
type name(type1 arg1,type2 arg2,type3 arg3) \
{ \
long __res; \
__asm__ volatile (  "int $0x80" \
                  : "=a" (__res) \
                  : "0" (__NR_##name),"b" ((long)(arg1)),"c" ((long)(arg2)), \
                    "d" ((long)(arg3))); \
__syscall_return(type,__res); \
}
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p> Whenever a system call with three arguments is made, the macro shown above is used to make the call.
The syscall number is placed in eax, then each parameters in ebx, ecx, edx. And finally "int 0x80" is the 
instruction which makes the system call work. The return value can be collected from eax.
</p><p>
</p><p> Every system calls are implemented in a similar way. Exit is a single parameter syscall and let’s see how 
it’s code will look like. 
It is as shown below.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>
<hr>
<pre>{
        asm("movl $1,%%eax;         /* SYS_exit is 1 */
             xorl %%ebx,%%ebx;      /* Argument is in ebx, it is 0 */
             int  $0x80"            /* Enter kernel mode */
             );
}
</pre>
<hr>
</code></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p> The number of exit is "1" and here, it’s parameter is 0. So we arrange eax to 
contain 1 and ebx to contain 0 and by <code>int $0x80</code>, the <code>exit(0)</code> is 
executed. This is how exit works.
