<h2>How System Calls Work on Linux/i86</h2>

<p>This section covers first the mechanisms provided by the 386
for handling system calls, and then shows how Linux uses those
mechanisms.  This is not a reference to the individual system
calls: There are very many of them, new ones are added
occasionally, and they are documented in man pages that should
be on your Linux system.

</p><h3>What Does the 386 Provide?</h3>

<p>The 386 recognizes two event classes: exceptions and
interrupts.  Both cause a forced context switch to new a
procedure or task.  Interrupts can occur at unexpected times
during the execution of a program and are used to respond to
signals from hardware.  Exceptions are caused by the execution
of instructions.

</p><p>Two sources of interrupts are recognized by the 386:
Maskable interrupts and Nonmaskable interrupts.  Two sources of
exceptions are recognized by the 386: Processor detected
exceptions and programmed exceptions.

</p><p>Each interrupt or exception has a number, which is referred
to by the 386 literature as the vector.  The NMI interrupt and
the processor detected exceptions have been assigned vectors in
the range 0 through 31, inclusive.  The vectors for maskable
interrupts are determined by the hardware.  External interrupt
controllers put the vector on the bus during the
interrupt-acknowledge cycle.  Any vector in the range 32
through 255, inclusive, can be used for maskable interrupts or
programmed exceptions.  Here is a listing of all the possible
interrupts and exceptions:
<table border="">
<tbody><tr><th>0</th><td>divide error</td></tr>
<tr><th>1</th><td>debug exception</td></tr>
<tr><th>2</th><td>NMI interrupt</td></tr>
<tr><th>3</th><td>Breakpoint</td></tr>
<tr><th>4</th><td>INTO-detected Overflow</td></tr>
<tr><th>5</th><td>BOUND range exceeded</td></tr>
<tr><th>6</th><td>Invalid opcode</td></tr>
<tr><th>7</th><td>coprocessor not available</td></tr>
<tr><th>8</th><td>double fault</td></tr>
<tr><th>9</th><td>coprocessor segment overrun</td></tr>
<tr><th>10</th><td>invalid task state segment</td></tr>
<tr><th>11</th><td>segment not present</td></tr>
<tr><th>12</th><td>stack fault</td></tr>
<tr><th>13</th><td>general protection</td></tr>
<tr><th>14</th><td>page fault</td></tr>
<tr><th>15</th><td>reserved</td></tr>
<tr><th>16</th><td>coprocessor error</td></tr>
<tr><th>17-31</th><td>reserved</td></tr>
<tr><th>32-255</th><td>maskable interrupts</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>The priority of simultaneous interrupts and exceptions is:
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>HIGHEST</th><td>Faults except debug faults</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">.</td><td>Trap instructions INTO, INT n, INT 3</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">.</td><td>Debug traps for this instruction</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">.</td><td>Debug traps for next instruction</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">.</td><td>NMI interrupt</td></tr>
<tr><th>LOWEST</th><td>INTR interrupt</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><h3>How Linux Uses Interrupts and Exceptions</h3>

<p>Under Linux the execution of a system call is invoked by a
maskable interrupt or <b>exception</b> class transfer, caused
by the instruction <tt>int 0x80</tt>.  We use vector 0x80 to
transfer control to the kernel. This interrupt vector is
initialized during system startup, along with other important
vectors like the system clock vector.

</p><p>iBCS2 requries an <tt>lcall 0,7</tt> instruction, which
Linux can send to the iBCS2 compatibility module appropriate if
an iBCS2-compliant binary is being executed.  In fact, Linux
will assume that an iBCS2-compliant binary is being executed if
an <tt>lcall 0,7</tt> call is executed, and will automatically
switch modes.

</p><p>As of version 0.99.2 of Linux, there are 116 system calls.
Documentation for these can be found in the man (2) pages. When
a user invokes a system call, execution flow is as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Each call is vectored through a stub in libc.  Each call
within the libc library is generally a
<tt>syscall<i>X</i>()</tt> macro, where <tt><i>X</i></tt> is
the number of parameters used by the actual routine. Some
system calls are more complex then others because of variable
length argument lists, but even these complex system calls must
use the same entry point: they just have more parameter setup
overhead.  Examples of a complex system call include
<tt>open()</tt> and <tt>ioctl()</tt>.
</li><li>Each syscall macro expands to an assembly routine which
sets up the calling stack frame and calls
<tt>_system_call()</tt> through an interrupt, via the
instruction <tt>int $0x80</tt>

<p>For example, the setuid system call is coded as<br>
<tt>_syscall1(int,setuid,uid_t,uid);</tt><br>
which will expand to:
</p><pre>_setuid:
  subl $4,%exp
  pushl %ebx
  movzwl 12(%esp),%eax
  movl %eax,4(%esp)
  movl $23,%eax
  movl 4(%esp),%ebx
  int $0x80
  movl %eax,%edx
  testl %edx,%edx
  jge L2
  negl %edx
  movl %edx,_errno
  movl $-1,%eax
  popl %ebx
  addl $4,%esp
  ret
L2:
  movl %edx,%eax
  popl %ebx
  addl $4,%esp
  ret
</pre>
The macro definition for the <tt>syscall<i>X</i>()</tt> macros
can be found in /usr/include/linux/unistd.h, and the user-space
system call library code can be found in /usr/src/libc/syscall/

</li><li>At this point no system code for the call has been
executed. Not until the <tt>int $0x80</tt> is executed does the
call transfer to the kernel entry point
<tt>_system_call()</tt>.  This entry point is the same for all
system calls. It is responsible for saving all registers,
checking to make sure a valid system call was invoked and then
ultimately transfering control to the actual system call code
via the offsets in the <tt>_sys_call_table</tt>.  It is also
responsible for calling <tt>_ret_from_sys_call()</tt> when the
system call has been completed, but before returning to user
space.

<p>Actual code for <tt>system_call</tt> entry point can be found
in /usr/src/linux/kernel/sys_call.S Actual code for many of the
system calls can be found in /usr/src/linux/kernel/sys.c, and
the rest are found elsewhere. <tt>find</tt> is your friend.

</p></li><li>After the system call has executed,
<tt>_ret_from_sys_call()</tt> is called.  It checks to see if
the scheduler should be run, and if so, calls it.

</li><li>Upon return from the system call, the
<tt>syscall<i>X</i>()</tt> macro code checks for a negative
return value, and if there is one, puts a positive copy of the
return value in the global variable <tt>_errno</tt>, so that it
can be accessed by code like <tt>perror()</tt>.
</li></ul>

<h3>How Linux Initializes the system call vectors</h3>

<p>The <tt>startup_32()</tt> code found in
/usr/src/linux/boot/head.S starts everything off by calling
<tt>setup_idt()</tt>. This routine sets up an IDT (Interrupt
Descriptor Table) with 256 entries.  No interrupt entry points
are actually loaded by this routine, as that is done only after
paging has been enabled and the kernel has been moved to
0xC0000000. An IDT has 256 entries, each 4 bytes long, for a
total of 1024 bytes.

When <tt>start_kernel()</tt> (found in /usr/src/linux/init/main.c) is
called it invokes <tt>trap_init()</tt> (found in
/usr/src/linux/kernel/traps.c).  <tt>trap_init()</tt> sets up the IDT via
the macro <tt>set_trap_gate()</tt> (found in /usr/include/asm/system.h).
<tt>trap_init()</tt> initializes the interrupt descriptor table as shown
here:
<table border="">
<tbody><tr><th>0</th><td>divide_error</td></tr>
<tr><th>1</th><td>debug</td></tr>
<tr><th>2</th><td>nmi</td></tr>
<tr><th>3</th><td>int3</td></tr>
<tr><th>4</th><td>overflow</td></tr>
<tr><th>5</th><td>bounds</td></tr>
<tr><th>6</th><td>invalid_op</td></tr>
<tr><th>7</th><td>device_not_available</td></tr>
<tr><th>8</th><td>double_fault</td></tr>
<tr><th>9</th><td>coprocessor_segment_overrun</td></tr>
<tr><th>10</th><td>invalid_TSS</td></tr>
<tr><th>11</th><td>segment_not_present</td></tr>
<tr><th>12</th><td>stack_segment</td></tr>
<tr><th>13</th><td>general_protection</td></tr>
<tr><th>14</th><td>page_fault</td></tr>
<tr><th>15</th><td>reserved</td></tr>
<tr><th>16</th><td>coprocessor_error</td></tr>
<tr><th>17</th><td>alignment_check</td></tr>
<tr><th>18-48</th><td>reserved</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
At this point the interrupt vector for the system calls is not
set up. It is initialized by <tt>sched_init()</tt> (found in
/usr/src/linux/kernel/sched.c). A call to <tt>set_system_gate
(0x80, &amp;system_call)</tt> sets interrupt 0x80 to be a vector to
the <tt>system_call()</tt> entry point.


</p><h3>How to Add Your Own System Calls</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a directory under the /usr/src/linux/ directory to hold
your code.

</li><li>Put any include files in /usr/include/sys/ and /usr/include/linux/.

</li><li>Add the relocatable module produced by the link of your new
kernel code to the <tt>ARCHIVES</tt> and the subdirectory to
the <tt>SUBDIRS</tt> lines of the top level Makefile. See
fs/Makefile, target fs.o for an example.

</li><li>Add a <tt>#define __NR_<i>xx</i></tt> to unistd.h to assign
a call number for your system call, where <tt><i>xx</i></tt>,
the index, is something descriptive relating to your system
call. It will be used to set up the vector through
<tt>sys_call_table</tt> to invoke you code.

</li><li>Add an entry point for your system call to the
<tt>sys_call_table</tt> in sys.h. It should match the index
(<tt><i>xx</i></tt>) that you assigned in the previous step.
The <tt>NR_syscalls</tt> variable will be recalculated
automatically.

</li><li>Modify any kernel code in kernel/fs/mm/, etc. to take into
account the environment needed to support your new code.

</li><li>Run make from the top level to produce the new kernel
incorporating your new code.
</li></ol>
At this point, you will have to either add a syscall to your
libraries, or use the proper <tt>_syscall<i>n</i>()</tt> macro
in your user program for your programs to access the new system
call.
