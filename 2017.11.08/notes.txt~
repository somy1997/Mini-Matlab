Following things need to be taken care of :

Assembly codes need to be in x86_64 //same in seniors also
Instead of arrays in the symboltable now there would be matrix
The functions designed from the assignment 2 need to be used
handle scopes
handle global variables in static region
there is some problem in handling doubles directly especially initialisation
need to handle doubles
change the assignment 2 functions
modify for double
the main has to be put in target_translator


modifications :

First adding all the functions in assignment 2 in the global symbol table
stringslabel: strings being added in the symbol table as well as this vector
mark labels function in glob_st
global variables function in glob_st
Above means see the handling of global declarations
translator's main function
